					<strong><strong></strong>A bit of background: </strong>

<p>On April 4th 2012, President Obama signed the American Jobs act into law, containing a provision 
that 
made crowd-funding legal for the first time since 1933.  (Not that they called it that back then.)  In 
reaction to the poor oversight of securities transactions, Roosevelt signed the Securities Act of 1933 
as part of the New Deal.  While this protected the public, the consequence was that only the wealthy, 
dubbed sophisticated investors, could invest in early stage companies.  Now, 80 years later times have 
changed; online transactions can be monitored closely, leading to a degree of transaction 
accountability that couldn't have been imagined in the '30s.</p>

<strong>So what's with the countdown?</strong>

<p>While the Jobs Act was indeed signed into law on April 4th, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
was 
given a 270 day grace period of sorts to implement the regulation. </p>

<strong>So what happens after the regulation is implemented?</strong>

<p>After the SEC is all set, an entrepreneur will be able to raise $1 million annually. from any 
number of 
unaccredited investors (regular people).</p>

<strong>Investors are subject to the following stipulations under the law</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Those with an income under $100,000 will only be able to invest $2,000 or 5% of their 
annual income (whichever is greater).</li>
	<li>Those with a net worth or annual income, exceeding $100,000 may invest 10% of annual or net 
worth (again, whichever is greater).  This 10% however may not exceed $100,000.</li>
</ol>
<strong>So what now?</strong>

<p>UpSmart is setting itself up to help entrepreneurs take advantage of this law when it becomes 
implemented and you can too.  Get involved with our companies , maintain dialogue with their 
representatives and provide feedback on their designs and products.  This really is an exciting point 
in history that could mark a fundamental change in American Finance.  We at UpSmart think it's about 
time and we can't wait to be a part of it.</p>
